# mpox

This folder has mpox results in `results.tsv` (this is also in the
supplementary spreadsheet). Running this script:

```
./plots_and_summary_stats.py
```

makes the supplementary figures, and prints the result of the Spearman
correlation between the estimated assembly lengths and those made by Viridian:

```
spearman r and p: 0.7025147332233111 1.691573132046351e-27
```
